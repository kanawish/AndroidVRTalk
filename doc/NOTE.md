# Notes regarding `/doc`

I'm using git flow, trying to document work on feature in individual `.md` files. For now, I've been opening and closing feature branch modeling or liveCoding based on readiness-to-publish. 

This explains why the feature documentation files in this folder will probably grow over time to be quite sizeable. It will be important to try and keep them up to date to reflect the state of the code base.
